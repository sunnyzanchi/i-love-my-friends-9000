I Love My Friends 9000
======================
This document outlines the requirements for I Love My Friends 9000. This is more of an idea list than a strictly defined roadmap. This is a living document, and will change as the project progresses.

End-User Functionality
----------------------
+ Create a profile for themselves, then be able to be found by other users (based on privacy settings)
+ Add users to their friends list
+ Collaborate on gifts
+ Create birthdays for users they are not friends with, and if they find the same person at a later time, it should tie to that user
+ Create birthdays that are not associated with any users, with all the same functionality

Front-end
---------
+ Be responsive, working equally as well on all form factors, with no degradation in performance or loss of functionality
+ Closely follow the Material Design style guidelines
+ Respond to touch and pointer events intuitively (slide from left to show drawer, etc)
+ Client side routing will match server side routes, so that page reloads or links to a particular route cause the server to send the correct information

Back-end
--------
+ Node.js for the web server
+ MongoDB for the database
